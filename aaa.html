		<h1>Sonnet 116: Let me not to the marriage of true minds</h1> <br>
		<h2><u>BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</u></h2>
		
	
	<h3>Let me not to the marriage of true minds 
Admit impediments. Love is not love <br>
Which alters when it alteration finds, <br>
Or bends with the remover to remove. <br>
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark <br>
That looks on tempests and is never shaken; <br>
It is the star to every wand'ring <a href="bark.html">bark,</a> <br>
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. <br>
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks <br>
Within his bending sickle's compass come; <br>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, <br>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom. <br>
If this be error and upon me prov'd, <br>
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.</h3><br><br>
